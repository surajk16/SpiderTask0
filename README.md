## Myself

I'm K.A.Sudharsan  studying Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. I love coding and whenever I find free time I code. You can checkout my Hackerrank progress [here!](https://www.hackerrank.com/surajk16?hr_r=1) 

If you want to check out about my social life, [here's](https://www.facebook.com/krishnasuraj) the link to my Facebook account. 
You might be wondering why my name is Suraj Krishna all over instead of Sudharsan. It's just an alias of mine. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

And if you want to know how I look, here's it:

So, basically my hobbies are:
- Coding :heart::heart: (My first love :grin::grin: )
- Watching TV series
  - Game of Thrones (my second love :heart::heart:)
  - Friends
  - Sherlock
  - Flash
- Listening to music
- Playing games like FIFA, CS GO,etc.

I basically know to code properly in C and C++ and I'm hoping to learn more in the near future.

I maybe bragging about myself over here but I just want to mention the fact that me and my partner won the **Hunt the Code** competition held for the first years as a part of Pragyan Inhott and also qualified to the finals of **Reverse Coding** held at IITM as a part of Shaastra,2016. :innocent::innocent:
